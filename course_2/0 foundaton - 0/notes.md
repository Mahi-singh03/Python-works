  NOTES

code -----> byte code ------> virtual machine (codes run hear)

copile to byte code (low level code) (this byte code can be run in alsmost any virtual machine)

  __pycache__  OR .pyc

* its compiled code
* the file inside the __pycache__ is also called frozen binary
  source change & python version
* .pyc works only for imported files


PVM (python virtual machine)

* helps to executes the code
* Run time engine
* pyhon interperator


Byte code is not machine code
its python specific interperation.
