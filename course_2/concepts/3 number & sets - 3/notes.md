 Number
-

*  you can do all mathematical calculation operator like : /, *, + , -, ** etc.
* can you can also use comparion/relationa like : <,>,=,<=,>=,!=, !<, !> etc
* can you can also use logical like : not, or, and etc
* pricision of Python is infinite

all these operatins can be done using the Numbers



    NUMERS ARE OF THESE TYPES:
* integer
* Float
* complex number ( example : 2+5j )
* Number with different bases ( exapmle : binary, octal , haxadeciaml etc)
* bit wise number

it is perfer to use the  type conversion/ type casting.

    Math module
 * use in "import math" statment to use math module.
 * use "math.function()" to the use the function from the math module.

there are various functions and method you ca use  feo m math library.

    random module
 * use the "import random" to use  random module
 * use "random.function()" to use random  module functions

this modules is used in all shot of randomization in the python

     Decials moduke

 * use the "import Deciaml" to use  Decimal module
 * use "Decimal.function()" to use Decimal  module functions

 working with deciaml  value / float value can be tricky, to make it easier the decimal module is used as shown in code,py .


 sets
 -
 * sets are mutable data objects in python ie. you can edit, add, remove the element from the sets.
 * set  in python are represented by {value1, value2, value3, .....}
 * the empty set is not represented by " {} " but by "set()" bescause " {} " is also known as empty dictionary
 * you can do all the basic mathematical operations on the set like : union, intersection, superset and many more.
