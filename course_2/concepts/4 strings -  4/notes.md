* you cannot update the character at any index
* yu can ony assign the new string to same variable to update the strinig

    String indexing 

 * indexing helps to locate the character in string 
 * indexing always starts feom the 0 index

there are two types of indexing:

1) Positive indexing (for negetive indexing the index starts from -1)
2) Negetive indexing (for negetive indexing the index starts from -1)

examples of these are inside code.py




    Slicing

* slicing refers to triming of the string
* the syntex of the slicing the string is " Str_Name [ start_ingIndex : Last_index : hoping value ] "


the examples of all different indexing are inside code.py




    String methods

there are various methods/ function that can be used on the string to alter the String. some of them are :

1.  Concatination ( + )    { used to add two strings }
2. length of str ( len(str) )       { used to find the length of string }
3. list str ( list ( str ) )    { conver the string into array}
4. join str  { join the particular and each index }
5.  str.endswith("er")  { cheacks if hte string end with "er" and return true and false}
6.   string.captilize( )  { Caotalize the first character}

8.  str.find(word) {search for the word and return the 1st occurence}
9.  str.count("a")   { return the count of an in the string} 
10. str.strip( ) { return the string with removed extrea spaces} 
 
Example of allthe string functions are inside the code.py


    Formaiting in string

* used to print the string in any order

example for the formating in the string is inside code.py
