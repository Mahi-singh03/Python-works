# [1] Automatic converstion:

# computer do such converstion automaticaly but only for similler types i.e conver int to float
  #but ot string to int

# Example:

# print ("1 + '2' = ", 1+"2")    # give error  ans 1 is number but "2" is string


# print(" 1 + 7.89 =",1+7.89)    # no error as computer do automatic converstion 
                                    #because int and float are simmiler 










# [2] Ttpe casting :

# this converstion is done manually by the user

# Example 

print(" 1 + '2' =", 1 + int("2"))   # no error as string 2 is type casted into the int
